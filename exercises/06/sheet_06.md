Exercise Sheet 6
================

A) MMUL tiling
--------------

Take the "mmul" small sample program and apply a tiling optimization to its main computation loop nest.
Think about which loop(s) to tile in order to achieve a meaningful performance benefit, and argue why your choice makes sense in terms of reuse distance reduction.

Test various tiling options on LCC3 (either manually or in an automated fashion) and report the results. Attempt to provide an explanation for the best parameter choices you found.

Note: use a **2048Â²** matrix for this benchmark.

I tried tiling on the first initialization loops:

```c
// A contains real values
for (int ti=0; ti < N/TILE_X; ti++){
  for (int tj=0; tj < M/TILE_Y; tj++){
    for (int i=TILE_X*ti; i < MIN(TILE_X*(ti+1),N); i++) {
      for (int j=TILE_Y*tj; j < MIN(TILE_Y*(tj+1),M); j++) {
        A[i][j] = i*j;
      }
    }
  }
}


// B is the identity matrix
for (int ti=0; ti < N/TILE_X; ti++){
  for (int tj=0; tj < M/TILE_Y; tj++){
    for (int i=TILE_X*ti; i < MIN(TILE_X*(ti+1),N); i++) {
      for (int j=TILE_Y*tj; j < MIN(TILE_Y*(tj+1),M); j++) {
        B[i][j] = (i==j)?1:0;
      }
    }
  }
}
``` 


and the main computation loop:

```c
for (int ti=0; ti < N; ti += TILE_X){
  for (int tj=0; tj < K; tj += TILE_Y){
    for (int tk=0; tk < M; tk += 16){
      for (int i=ti; i < MIN(TILE_X + ti, N); i++) {
        for (int j=tj; j < MIN(TILE_Y + tj, K); j++) {
          TYPE sum = 0;
          for (int k=tk; k < MIN(16 + tk, M); k++) {
            sum += A[i][k] * B[k][j];
          }
          C[i][j] += sum;
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Here I added tiling of the inner loop rather last-minute, so I didn't do proper measurements. But I don't think I got major improvements.

Running some tests with different tile sizes we get the following times (means over 12 runs, removing values with a z score bigger then 3):

>The reference has a mean of 71.86s and std of 0.7395.

### apply tiling only on initialization

### apply tiling only on main loop 
![](./mmul/mult_mean.png) 
### apply tiling on both init and main
![](./mmul/both_mean.png) 

and the following medians:
### apply tiling only on initialization
![](./mmul/init_median.png) 
### apply tiling only on main loop 
![](./mmul/mult_median.png) 
### apply tiling on both init and main
![](./mmul/both_median.png) 

### The best times look as follows:
![mean](./mmul/top_means.png) 
![median](./mmul/top_medians.png) 
![max](./mmul/top_maxs.png) 
![min](./mmul/top_mins.png) 

> I think something went pretty wrong in my tiling , as there should be major time improvements.
